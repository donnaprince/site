										<p>
											Welcome to my engineering portfolio. Here you will get to know more about me, Donna Prince. 
											I am a student at the Dublin Engineering and Design Academy in the Computer Science cohort. 
											As a part of the academy, I have taken PLTW Computer Science Principles, PLTW Honors Principles
											of Engineering, and AP Computer Science Applications. This year I will be a TA for an engineering
											course. To enrich myself with more knowledge pertaining to engineering, I have taken 10+ courses 
											at my local community college. Aside from computer science, I also have experience in marketing
											and product management.

										<br>
										<br>
											 “Xp7t34sg36l72hshd”, a combination of random numbers and letters summarized my understanding of 
											engineering. While this perception proved inaccurate, I was welcomed with the print “Hello World”,  
											in my 9th-grade computer science course. Next, I took my first steps creating hangman using Python. 
											This is when I finally understood what was typed into computers, what seemed like gibberish now had a
											new dimension of meaning. After the first year of being introduced to the world of CS, I applied to my
											school's engineering academy and was selected for their CS cohort. After being accepted to our academy,
											I was allowed to learn about various types of engineering such as mechanical, electrical, and civil. 
											While this mandatory class was placed with the idea to introduce us to new fields, I stayed put with
											my passion for computer science. With this new love for computer science, I would take an AP course in
											computer science. I continued my journey by working with STEM nonprofits, and internships related to 
											software engineering.
								
											<br>
											<br>
											
											Thank you for taking the time to read my website. If you would like to know more about me and my engineering 
											accomplishments, continue to other sections of the website. Overall, this page gave you more insight into 
											myself, a budding computer software engineer.

										<p>
											I mentored a group of 25 freshmen at Dublin High School, three times a week. 
											As a mentor, I had the responsibility of ensuring that students can adapt to 
											the new lifestyle in high school, know about school events, and are not falling
											behind in their coursework. I would help them transition to high school by presenting
											them information on school events every Monday, supporting them with coursework, and 
											playing games to ease their stress. Through this program, I was able to interact with
											new students and break the stereotype about the relationship between upperclassmen and
											underclassmen. I would also have a meeting with our advisor every month to improve the
											program and analyze the feedback given to us by parents/students.

										</em>
										
										<p>
											I fostered an interest in STEM fields for the visitors at the hall and 
											engaged them with the iterative engineering design process. Some of the 
											activities that I explained was creating a prosthetic hand, pinball machines,
											and marble machines. I interacted with over 300 young students and worked with
											them on their innovations. I was also tasked with setting up and cleaning this
											section of the hall. Lastly, I would track the number of visitors for our section,
											using a clicker and logged this information. During my 2019 summer at the Hall, 
											I accumulated a total of 33 hours. I was selected as an intern for 2020, which
											unfortunately got canceled.

													<h6>August 29, 2017 to September 7, 2017</h6>
													<h6>Group Project</h6>
													<!--project popup description-->
													<p>
														My very first project in my first computer science course was utilizing the Scratch platform. 
														The overall objective of the project was to accumulate knowledge about variable roles and 
														receive an overview of engineering by creating a game in Scratch. Our group chose to create a 
														game titled Maze-Tastic!. We organized our brainstorming using a flowchart and tracked our 
														progress on a document. In this project, I was tasked with the documentation and commenting on 
														our code. One skill assimilated from the project was how to document all the information accurately
														and in an orderly fashion. Another strength, I was able to garner was using Scratch in different 
														ways to code the same function. In the project, our team was able to produce a very refined game 
														due to our teamwork.

														The overall objective of the project was to utilize our knowledge in Python. 
														In this project, we had to choose a client for whom we had to cater to our 
														image manipulations. Using Python, we were able to create functions that allowed
														the client to choose the color of the border, as they wanted an array of options. 
														The cause we decided to convey was the caging of animals in zoos. To emphasize 
														this injustice to the animals, we manipulated the images, by changing the colors 
														of certain sections, added a border to the image, provided a short caption, to 
														capture our stance on this cause, and masked an image of bars on top of the image.
														My contribution to this project was the documentation, commenting on code, and coding
														for different manipulations. One skill that I accumulated from the project was how 
														to code in an orderly fashion and understand the differences between NumPy and PIL.
														Another strength, which I was able to garner in Python was also being able to understand 
														different file paths and the different image extensions such as .jpg or .png. Above, is the 
														slideshow consisting of all the images before and after being manipulated.

													<h6> November 1, 2018 and November 16, 2018</h6>
													<h6>Group Project</h6>
													
													<!--project popup description-->
													<p>
														The main objective of this project was to ensure a vehicle can run on a combination 
														of hydrogen and solar cells with the greatest speed and efficiency. The client for 
														the vehicle was the renowned car company Tesla, who needed assistance in choosing a 
														new clean power supply that will benefit the company. To plan out the necessary tasks
														that need to be completed each day, we used <a 
														href ="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UiNAe4IgjAFYaT7d-gyvkZKIPbd6s6IcREkH6DnjdgU/edit?usp=sharing" target="blank">
														Google Sheets</a> to create a Gantt Chart. An
														aspect that I contributed to this project in regards to the documentation was writing 
														the description of all the modifications we made and doing all the calculations, such
														as speed, electrical power, mechanical power, and efficiency for the various combinations 
														of power sources. In terms of building the vehicle, I assisted tightening the various cells 
														to the vehicle and did the breadboarding for the car to run. One skill acquired from the 
														project was how to be persistent, as our team had difficulties, creating a car that met 
														all the constraints, resulting in us creating multiple car prototypes. Another strength,
														which I was able to garner was learning the science behind powering hydrogen cells, using 
														a power station, and using a UV lamp for the solar cells to run. Through this project, our
														team was able to produce a well-developed vehicle and recommended the solar source powered 
														in parallel to Tesla, as it was the fastest. Above are a few photos that reveal the different
														configurations the vehicle was able to run on.

													<h4>Dart Bridge</h4>
													<h6>March 6, 2018- March 25, 2018</h6>
													<h6>Partner Project</h6>
													
													<!--project popup description-->
													<p>
														The main intention of this project was to create a highway, on the software
														West Point Bridge. Our client, American Bridge Company, had been contracted
														to construct a bridge crossing part of the Trinity River. The decision matrix
														for this project was created on a <a href= "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13JrWiSIXBLHb8rwO3yK4s4yq8-eLFfLy33ecAXsBssw/edit?usp=sharing"
														target ="blank"> Google Sheet </a>, in which the four prototypes 
														created were compared with one another, using point distribution rubric. The 
														constraint that we faced in this project was not being able to cross the budget of 
														$300,000, but we were able to spend $298,000. To be cost-effective we used the 
														cheapest material, carbon steel on the Hinge Arch-Warren truss template. The
														concept of engineering applied to this project was how to ensure the bridge would
														undergo the least amount of tension (blue colored members) and compression 
														(red-colored members). To do this, members that did not undergo any pressure were 
														then reduced in size, while members that had tension/compression were increased in 
														size, thus reducing their tension/compression. An aspect that I contributed to this 
														project in regards to the documentation was writing the design brief, decision matrix 
														paragraph, annotating our final solution prototypes. In terms of creating a bridge 
														prototype, I created two prototypes that performed well under the tension and compression 
														the bridge underwent as a result of the truck crossing the bridge. Through this project,
														our team was able to produce a bridge that had very little movement indicating the ability 
														of the bridge to withstand the heavy load. Above, is a video that demonstrates the high
														quality of our two-lane highway.

													<h4>Seating Chart</h4>
													<h6>August 29, 2019 to September 7, 2019</h6>
													<h6>Individual Project</h6>
													<!--project popup description-->
													<p>
														The main objective of this project was to create a seating chart for our class.
														The client of the project was our teacher. This served as a tool to check where 
														the student sat and how to pronounce the students' names. One skill acquired from
														the project was reinforcing my knowledge about the basics of programming, as this
														was my first time programming in Java. Another strength, which I was able to garner
														was learning that it was essential to communicate with my peers. Even though the
														project was individual, we all had to push to one Git Repository and ensure that 
														we were in the right location, before pushing our code. The Git Master (person in 
														charge of merging all our code) coordinated everyone's code, and was able to finalize 
														the seating chart. Through this project, I was able to create a place in the seating 
														chart that corresponds to where I sat, that met all the requirements, and more as I also
														completed the extra credit. Above, is the video of the seating chart, demonstrating how 
														it can be a helpful tool for the teacher.

													<h4>Sound Library</h4>
													<h6>January 7, 2020 to January 22, 2020</h6>
													<h6>Partner Project</h6>
													
													<!--project popup description-->
													<p>
														The main objective of this project was to create a 7-10 minute presentation about
														a Java library. The client of the project was our classmates as they were able to
														learn about Java libraries that they did not know about previously. Additionally, 
														to explain the capabilities of the library, we had to use the library to create a 
														software application. One skill acquired from the project was learning about a new
														library. Another skill that I was able to hone through this project was communicating 
														with a diverse group of students and ensuring they learn about the library in depth.
														One major problem that we had to overcome was figuring out which application to create
														and how it would best demonstrate some of the library capabilities. We soon settled on
														creating a music application, given that we both have musical backgrounds. In our app, 
														we catered it to musicians who would like to tune their instruments, catered many towards 
														violinists and pianists. The app allows for musicians to play the note once, or play it
														multiple times to ensure that their instrument is tuned correctly to play their musical 
														pieces accurately. Above, is the presentation and demonstration of the application that we 
														created and presented to our peers.
